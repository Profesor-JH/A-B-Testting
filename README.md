Their company is based on the principle of voluntary participation which is proven to increase brand engagement and memorability 10 x more than static alternatives. 


Challenge : As a Machine learning engineer in SmartAd, one of your tasks is to design a reliable hypothesis testing algorithm for the BIO service and to determine whether a recent advertising campaign resulted in a significant lift in brand awareness.


Solution :The A/B testing framework is the most used statistical framework for making gradual but important changes in every aspect of today’s business

How does the classical A/B testing (using z-test, f-test, etc.) framework work?
The type of test chosen should be based on the sample size and what form you want your hypotheses to test. If you are looking for a specific effect from A/B test, then opt for a z-test or t-test depending on sample size and the knowledge of the population variance. If you want to show that a relationship merely exists, the Fisher’s exact test is appropriate.

Advantages of sequential A/B testing 
•	Optimize necessary observation (sample size)
•	Reduce the likelihood of error
•	Gives a chance to finish experiments earlier without increasing the possibility of false results.
